# INDECISION APP

## This app makes the decision for you based on the options provided. Comes in handy especially on choosing where to eat.

##### A few more things still needs to be done before making it live but it's already at 80% of completion.

##### For now this README is more of a space for notes and todos.

## :notebook:

- The app is based on a tutorial by Andrew Mead.
- After completing momentum app, I felt like I was still struggling with some of the key concepts of React. Hence I went through the tutorial to build a concrete understanding on the language.

## :clipboard:

    - Color theme for the app.
    - Update README
